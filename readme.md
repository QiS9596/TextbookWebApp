# TextBookHelper
This is a web application for text analysis on text books. Our final target is to use retrieved information from textbooks to help the user achieve better understanding of knowledge.

## Branch
This is the **streamlitPrototype** branch.
In this branch we develop a prototype of the web application using a Python Package Streamlit.

## Dependencies
```
Python 3.6
Numpy 1.19.1
Pandas 1.0.5
Scikit-learn 0.23.1
Streamlit 0.63.1
NLTK 3.5
```
## Executing
To execute the web application, you'll have to have web browser and graphic user interface. On command line, execute <code>streamlit run app.py</code>. Then the web application will be automatically opened ithe browser. If not, use the browser to open the link shown in the command line.
